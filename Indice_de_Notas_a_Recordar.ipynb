The real challenges are getting programs completed quickly, ensuring their quality, and managing the complexity of large applications. Thus the primary design criterion for software should be simplicity, not speed.\n",

If you try to optimize the performance of an application during the initial construction you will add complexity that will impact the timely delivery and quality of the application and probably won't help performance at all; in fact, it could actually reduce the performance (\"faster\" algorithms often have larger constant factors, meaning they are slower at small scale and only become more efficient at large scale). I've found that in most situations the simplest code is also the fastest. So, don't worry about performance until the application is running; if it isn't fast enough, then go in and carefully measure to figure out where the performance bottlenecks are (they are likely to be in places you wouldn't have guessed). Tune only the places where you have measured that there is an issue."

The intuition helps me to focus my analysis, but it doesn't eliminate the need for analysis.\n",

Software is incredibly malleable: it can be updated with new versions relatively easily to fix problems and add new features. It is easier to change existing software than to build new software, so software tends to live a long time. To a first approximation, software doesn't die (compare this to the hardware in a computer, which is completely replaced every few years). At the same time, it is difficult to make major structural improvements to software once it has been shipped, so mistakes in early versions of the program often live forever. As a result, software tends to live too long: just good enough to discourage replacement, but slowly rotting away with more and more problems that are hard to fix. I wonder if the overall quality of computer software would improve if there were a way of forcing all software to be replaced after some period of time."

This has implications both for teaching and for working in unfamiliar areas.\n",

For example, a few years ago I started working on my first large Web application. My goal was to develop a library of reusable classes on which to base the application, but being new to Web development I had no idea what those classes should be. So, I built the first simple version of the application without any shared code, creating each page separately. Once I had developed a dozen pages I was able to identify areas of functionality that were repeated over and over in different pages, and from this I was able to develop a set of classes that implemented the the shared functionality.

For example, try reducing the scope of the change to find the smallest possible modification that causes the problem to come and go.

Either there will be bugs that you missed, or some of the features will be clumsy, or additional features will be needed. Sometimes the entire architecture turns out to be wrong.

One way to minimize this problem is to get your new software in use as soon as possible.

The world of computing is also fairly coherent: most of the world's computers run one of a few versions of Windows, and almost any computer in the world can be reached using the IP/TCP protocol. Human-engineered systems tend to be coherent.\n",

It's more efficient to have a single operating system running most of the world's computers: once a new facility is implemented for that system, everyone in the world can benefit from it.

Objects that tensors may map between include vectors and scalars, and even other tensors. Tensors can take several different forms – for example: scalars and vectors (which are the simplest tensors), dual vectors, multilinear maps between vector spaces, and even some operations such as the dot product. Tensors are defined independent of any basis, although they are often referred to by their components in a basis related to a particular "
