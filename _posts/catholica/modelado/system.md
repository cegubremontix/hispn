## Social Groups

In the social sciences, a social group can be defined as two or more people who interact with one another, share similar characteristics, and collectively have a sense of unity. Regardless, social groups come in a myriad of sizes and varieties. For example, a society can be viewed as a large social group.

The system of behaviors and psychological processes occurring within a social group or between social groups is known as group dynamics.

In this note, we will explore the emergent phenomena of collections of humans interacting together.

Some of the interesting questions about social group include:
- ¿How the size of the group impacts its properties?
- ¿How does collective intelligence making take place?
- ¿How to design reputation systems?
- ¿How influence works in groups?
- In Social Networks; ¿Which topics have become trendy?
- ¿How do prediction markets aggregate knowledge?
- How consussus arises in groups? [Polis](https://github.com/compdemocracy/polis) [Birdwatch: Crowd Wisdom and Bridgin Algorithms can Inform Understanding and Reduce the Spread of Misinformation](https://github.com/twitter/birdwatch/blob/main/birdwatch_paper_2022_10_27.pdf)

##  How to Categorize Societies

**Categorizing a society** can be a **complex** task as societies are multifaceted and can be analyzed from various perspectives. However, here are some common approaches to categorizing societies:

1. **Economic Systems**: One way to categorize societies is based on their economic systems. This includes distinguishing between capitalist societies, where the means of production are privately owned, and socialist or communist societies, where the means of production are collectively owned or controlled by the state.

2. **Political Systems**: Societies can be categorized based on their political systems, such as democracies, monarchies, autocracies, theocracies, or totalitarian regimes. This classification focuses on how power is distributed and exercised within a society.

3. **Social Structures**: Societies can also be categorized based on their social structures. For example, some societies may have hierarchical structures with distinct social classes, while others may have more egalitarian structures. Categorization can consider factors like social mobility, gender roles, and the presence of social institutions like family, education, and religion.

4. **Cultural Characteristics**: Societies can be categorized based on their cultural characteristics, such as language, religion, customs, and traditions. This approach considers shared beliefs, values, and norms that shape the collective identity of a society.

5. **Development Levels**: Societies can be categorized based on their development levels, such as developed, developing, or underdeveloped. This classification often takes into account factors like economic indicators, infrastructure, healthcare, education, and standard of living.

6. **Geographic or Ethnic Factors**: Some categorizations consider geographic or ethnic factors, such as Western societies, Eastern societies, African societies, Indigenous societies, etc. These classifications acknowledge the unique characteristics and influences of specific regions or ethnic groups.

It's important to note that societies are complex and multifaceted, and categorizing them using a single criterion may oversimplify their nature. To gain a more **comprehensive understanding**, it is often helpful to consider multiple perspectives and criteria when **categorizing a society**.

## Society Collapse

1. Definition of a Society
2. See several proceses of collapse.
3. Try to find pattterns in those proses of collapse.

“A society has collapsed when it displays a rapid, significant loss of an established level of sociopolitical complexity”.

Brozović, D. (2023). Societal collapse: A literature review.

> The Glorious Revolution did not make British government more 'inclusive' in the sense of sharing political  power with the working class (sa gloririfed by Acemoglu and Robinson) in their appriasal of the Arab Spring movement. It simply made the government more authoritarian adn powerful in levyign taxes, creating markets adn comercial networks, promoting manufactuirng and mercantilist trade, and reignign over the British economy.

## Models for Response to Decline of Quality of Services to a Group

1) Exit, Voice, Loyalty (Hirschman) 

It's a framework for modeling the decisions making processes that are taken when people in a group perceive the deteriorating quality of goods or services that are provided to them. The outcomes are exit or voice.

The model will be specific for each organization and the group that it serves.

## On Efects of the Group Size

What is the Ringelmann effect?

What is the name of the following effect “tendency for individual members of a group to become increasingly less productive as the size of their group increases”?

## On Colaboration

That’s from [“The Case Against Collaboration”](https://paulitaylor.com/2022/05/06/the-case-against-collaboration/), an interesting piece about how collaboration can be a very fine line to walk (especially in a business setting).

Work at MIT found that brainstorming—where a bunch of people put their heads together to try to come up with innovative solutions—generally “reduced creativity due to the tendency to incrementally modify known successful designs rather than explore radically different and potentially superior ones.”

## On Cultural Software

I'm surprised how many people don't get that genes =/= memes. Kinda like hardware =/= software. A population can change their memes (language, religion, mythology) several times and still remain genetically the same. Like if you change OS on yr laptop, it's still the same laptop 

Also we tend to exaggerate how deeply and rapidly the memes change. For example a "change of religion" would typically be a much more superficial phenomenon than one could assume reading the narrative sources (especially written by clergy)


## Trust

Trust is a fundamental aspect of human relationships and social interactions. It refers to the belief or confidence that one person has in another person's reliability, integrity, and competence. Trust is based on the expectation that the other person will behave in a certain way, and it is built over time through repeated positive interactions and experiences.

Trust is an essential component of successful relationships, whether they are personal or professional. It enables individuals to work together, cooperate, and engage in mutually beneficial exchanges. Trust also plays a crucial role in society, as it allows for the development of social and political institutions that rely on cooperation and collaboration.

In business, trust is critical for successful transactions and partnerships. It enables companies to work together, share information, and engage in mutually beneficial exchanges. Trust is also important for building strong customer relationships, as it creates a sense of reliability and consistency that encourages customers to continue doing business with a company.

Overall, trust is a complex and multifaceted concept that plays a crucial role in human relationships and social interactions. It is essential for building strong and successful relationships, both personal and professional, and is critical for the development of prosperous societies.

Fuyukama Ideas:

- **Trust is a critical component of social and economic development**: Fukuyama argues that trust is essential for the functioning of society and the economy. Without trust, individuals and organizations are less likely to engage in economic transactions, leading to lower levels of economic growth and development.

- **Trust can be built and sustained**: Fukuyama challenges the idea that trust is a fixed cultural trait or that it is dependent on factors such as ethnicity or religion. Instead, he argues that trust can be built and sustained through the development of social institutions, such as the rule of law, democratic governance, and civil society organizations.

- **Trust has both social and economic benefits**: Fukuyama argues that trust has both social and economic benefits. Socially, trust allows individuals to cooperate and work together for the common good. Economically, trust lowers transaction costs and enables more efficient economic activity.

- **The decline of trust has negative consequences**: Fukuyama argues that the decline of trust in society can have negative consequences, including higher levels of crime and corruption, lower levels of economic growth, and weaker social and political institutions.

**Measuring Trust**:

Modelling trust refers to the process of creating a conceptual or mathematical representation of how trust operates in human relationships and social interactions. The purpose of modelling trust is to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of trust, as well as to predict and explain trust-related behaviors and outcomes.

Modelling trust involves creating a simplified version of reality that captures the key variables and relationships that influence trust. These models may be based on empirical data, theoretical frameworks, or a combination of both. The models may also take different forms, such as mathematical equations, computer simulations, or conceptual diagrams.

Modelling trust is important because trust is a complex and multifaceted concept that can be difficult to understand and measure. By creating models of trust, researchers can test hypotheses, identify key factors that influence trust, and explore the implications of different scenarios and interventions. Modelling trust can also help to identify potential sources of trust breakdown and inform the development of strategies to build and maintain trust in different contexts, such as business, politics, and social relationships.

Measuring trust in a society is a complex and challenging task that requires a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. There are several approaches to measuring trust in society, including:

- **Surveys**: Surveys can be used to collect data on individuals' trust in various social institutions, such as government, the legal system, and other public and private organizations. Surveys can also be used to measure trust in interpersonal relationships.

- **Behavioral experiments**: Behavioral experiments can be used to measure trust by examining how individuals interact with each other in various economic and social contexts.

- **Trust games**: Trust games are a type of behavioral experiment that measures trust by examining how individuals make decisions in situations that require cooperation and mutual trust.

- **Social network analysis**: Social network analysis can be used to measure trust by examining the relationships between individuals and the networks of trust and cooperation that exist within a society.

- **Case studies**: Case studies can be used to provide qualitative insights into the factors that contribute to or undermine trust in a particular society or community.

Overall, measuring trust in a society requires a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods that take into account the complex and multifaceted nature of trust. By using a range of approaches, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to or undermine trust in a society.

## Social Capital

> Social Capital is a form of energy that gives rise to a society.

**Social Capital** refers to the value that is derived from the social networks and connections that individuals have. It encompasses the relationships, trust, and social norms that exist between people and within communities.

**Social Capital** can be seen as a resource that individuals and communities can draw upon to achieve their goals, whether they are personal, social, or economic in nature. It can manifest in different forms such as social support, information sharing, and collaboration, and can be built through social activities such as volunteering, community involvement, and networking.

Some of the benefits of **social capital** include access to information and resources, increased social support, improved health outcomes, and greater economic opportunities. On the other hand, a lack of social capital can result in social isolation, limited opportunities, and increased vulnerability.

## Social Identity

## Conformity

## Social Movements

## Social Mobility

## Culture

## Sociometry

**Sociometry** is a method used in sociology and social psychology to study social relationships and the patterns of interactions between individuals or groups. The term "sociometry" was coined by the psychologist Jacob Moreno in the early 20th century, and it is derived from the Latin word "socius" meaning "companion" or "ally" and "metrum" meaning "measurement".

**Sociometry** typically involves the use of surveys or questionnaires to gather data about social relationships, such as asking individuals to identify their friends, allies, or acquaintances within a particular social network. This data is then analyzed to identify patterns of social interaction, such as who is popular or well-liked, who is isolated or excluded, and who is central or peripheral to the network.

**Sociometry**  can be used to study a wide range of social phenomena, including social status, group dynamics, social influence, and social support. It is often used in organizational settings to improve communication and productivity, as well as in clinical settings to assess social support and social functioning in individuals with mental health or behavioral issues.

## Network Society

**Castells** argues that we are currently living in a new type of society characterized by global networks of communication and information exchange. These networks have transformed the way we live and work, and they have created new opportunities and challenges for individuals and communities.

## Social Mobility

## Methodologies Used to Characterize Societies

**Structural Functionalism**: This approach views society as a complex system with interconnected parts that work together to maintain social stability and order. It focuses on the functions and roles of various social institutions and how they contribute to the overall functioning of society.

**Conflict Theory**: This theory emphasizes social conflict and inequality as fundamental aspects of society. It examines how power struggles and competition between different groups shape social structures, institutions, and relationships.

**Symbolic Interactionism**: This perspective analyzes society by focusing on the meanings, symbols, and interactions between individuals. It explores how people construct and interpret social reality through their daily interactions and communication.

**Social Constructionism**: This framework examines how social phenomena, such as gender, race, and identity, are socially constructed through shared meanings and beliefs. It emphasizes the role of language, culture, and social interactions in shaping individual and collective experiences.

**Feminist Theory**: This theoretical perspective highlights the social, economic, and political inequalities experienced by women and advocates for gender equality. It explores the impact of gender on various aspects of society, including institutions, power dynamics, and cultural norms.

**Postcolonial Theory**: This approach examines the effects of colonialism and imperialism on societies, particularly in relation to power dynamics, cultural identity, and the legacy of colonial structures. It critiques dominant narratives and seeks to decolonize knowledge and perspectives.

**Historical Materialism**: This Marxist approach analyzes society by focusing on the relationship between economic systems, social classes, and historical development. It examines how economic factors shape social relations, institutions, and ideologies.

**Rational Choice Theory**: This perspective applies principles of rationality and self-interest to analyze individual and collective decision-making in social contexts. It explores how individuals weigh costs and benefits to maximize their outcomes and predicts social behavior based on these assumptions.

**Postmodernism**: This theoretical framework challenges traditional notions of objective truth and universal meaning. It emphasizes the diversity of perspectives and the complexity of social reality, often questioning established categories, grand narratives, and fixed identities.

**Comparative Analysis**: This methodology involves comparing different societies or social phenomena to identify similarities, differences, and patterns. It aims to understand the variations in social structures, cultures, institutions, and behaviors across different contexts.
