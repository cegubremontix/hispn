**Criminological models** are theoretical frameworks used to understand and explain the causes and factors related to criminal behavior. There are several **criminological models** that have been developed over the years, each offering a different perspective on the subject. Here is a list of some prominent **criminological models:

1. **Classical School of Criminology:** Developed by thinkers like `Cesare Beccaria` and `Jeremy Bentham``, this model emphasizes the rationality of criminals and the idea that individuals weigh the costs and benefits of committing crimes before engaging in criminal behavior.

2. **Positivist School of Criminology:** Positivist criminology focuses on the scientific study of crime and criminals. It includes sub-models like biological, psychological, and sociological positivism, which examine factors such as genetics, psychology, and social influences on criminal behavior.

3. **Strain Theory:** This model, popularized by Robert Merton, suggests that individuals turn to crime when they experience a disconnect between societal goals and the means available to achieve them. This disconnect creates strain, which can lead to criminal behavior.

4. **Social Learning Theory:** Developed by Albert Bandura, this theory posits that people learn criminal behavior through observation and imitation of others. It emphasizes the role of socialization and role models in criminal behavior.

5. **Control Theory:** Control theory, including `Travis Hirschi's` Social Bond Theory, proposes that individuals are naturally inclined to deviance and crime but are deterred by social bonds and attachments to conventional institutions, such as family and community.

6. **Labeling Theory:** Labeling theorists like `Howard Becker` argue that individuals become criminals when they are labeled as such by society. The label can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy, where the individual adopts the criminal identity.

7. **Routine Activities Theory:** Developed by `Lawrence E. Cohen` and Marcus Felson, this model suggests that crime occurs when there is a convergence of a motivated offender, a suitable target, and a lack of capable guardianship.

8. **Social Disorganization Theory:** This theory, associated with researchers such as Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay, examines how the breakdown of social institutions and community disorganization can lead to higher crime rates in certain neighborhoods.

9. **Life-Course Theory:** This model looks at the development of criminal behavior over an individual's life course, emphasizing the impact of different life events and transitions on criminal involvement.

10. **General Strain Theory:** Robert Agnew's General Strain Theory expands upon strain theory by considering various sources of strain, including negative emotions, as factors that can lead to criminal behavior.

11. **Routine Activity Theory:** Developed by Lawrence E. Cohen and Marcus Felson, this theory suggests that crime occurs when there is a convergence of a motivated offender, a suitable target, and a lack of capable guardianship.

12. **Social Bond Theory:** Travis Hirschi's Social Bond Theory posits that individuals are less likely to engage in criminal behavior when they have strong bonds to conventional institutions, such as family, school, and work.

13. **Biosocial Theory:** This model combines biological and sociological factors to explain criminal behavior, recognizing that both genetics and environmental factors play a role in an individual's propensity for crime.

14. **Conflict Theory:** Conflict theorists, such as Karl Marx, argue that crime is a result of social inequality and the struggle for power and resources in society. Crime is seen as a product of the unequal distribution of wealth and resources.

These are just some of the many criminological models that exist. Criminologists often use a combination of these models to better understand the complex nature of criminal behavior. Additionally, new models and theories continue to emerge as research in the field of criminology advances.
