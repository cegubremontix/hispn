# National Innovation System (NIS)

- What is the impact of research in the economy?
- How can we encourage innovation and technological progress?


> Knowledge is the foundation of economic growth, and innovation is its engine. - Cesar Hidalgo

> Innovation is not just about creating new products and services; it's also about creating new organizational forms and new ways of working together. - Cesar Hidalgo

> Innovation is not a solo sport. It requires collaboration, openness, and a willingness to share ideas.  - Cesar Hidalgo

> We are living in a world where we need to learn how to learn faster. - Cesar Hidalgo

> The most valuable resource we have is not oil or gold, but human creativity. -  Cesar Hidalgo

> If you build the right kind of infrastructure, it will encourage people to take risks, to start new businesses, to create new products, to create new services. It will create a virtuous cycle of innovation and growth. - Elon Musk

> Innovation is a complex and systemic process that involves a variety of actors, including individuals, firms, universities, research institutions, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. - Richard Nelson

> Build  the raods and the cards will come.

> Economic catch-up, as described by Keun Lee, is the process by which less developed economies strive to catch up with more advanced economies in terms of economic growth and technological innovation. This process involves a range of factors, including investment in human capital, infrastructure development, institutional capacity building, and innovation system development.

> Inertia kills economies; dynamism drives them. I see much cultural acceptance of "the way it's always been done" here. 

> The **German School** emphasized the importance of **empirical** research in economics, including using historical data and case studies. They believed that economic theory should be grounded in empirical observation and that abstract reasoning should be avoided.


> Let's say that they are n innovative problems in a country/moment. A national innovation system determines how those problems are tackled and how the solutions are going to flow in the economic actors of the country.

> National innovation systems (**NIS**) are the networks of institutions, organizations, and individuals that interact and collaborate to produce and diffuse new knowledge, technologies, and products within a specific country or region.

> **NIS** are shaped by a wide range of factors, including government policies, cultural norms, educational systems, scientific and technological capabilities, and the structure of the economy.

> **NIS** can be strengthened and made more effective through the development of supportive policies and institutions that encourage collaboration, knowledge sharing, and investment in research and development.

> Effective innovation systems require a balance between competition and cooperation, as well as a mix of public and private investments in research and development.

> Different countries have different strengths and weaknesses in their innovation systems, and it is important to understand the unique characteristics of each system in order to promote successful innovation policies and practices.

> **NIS** can reduce companies' cost if a shared research program attaches the everyday problems of the industry - collaboration - and make money indifferentism ej (services, business model, customer support, etc.) ...

A National Innovation System (NIS) refers to the network of institutions, organizations, policies, and resources that support innovation and technological development in a particular country. It is a concept developed by scholars and policymakers to describe the complex and interconnected set of factors that contribute to a country's ability to create and commercialize new technologies and products.

The **NIS** includes both formal and informal components, such as universities, research institutes, government agencies, private sector companies, venture capitalists, and innovation networks. These components interact and collaborate in a variety of ways, such as through research partnerships, technology transfer agreements, and funding mechanisms.

The goal of a **NIS** is to facilitate the flow of knowledge, resources, and ideas across different sectors and stakeholders to support innovation and economic growth. By promoting collaboration and coordination among various actors, a NIS can help create a favorable environment for innovation and ensure that new technologies are effectively diffused and commercialized. Many countries around the world have implemented policies and strategies to strengthen their national innovation systems and enhance their competitiveness in the global economy.

National innovation systems (NIS) are the networks of institutions, organizations, and individuals that interact and collaborate to produce and diffuse new knowledge, technologies, and products within a specific country or region.

NIS are shaped by a wide range of factors, including government policies, cultural norms, educational systems, scientific and technological capabilities, and the structure of the economy.

NIS can be strengthened and made more effective through the development of supportive policies and institutions that encourage collaboration, knowledge sharing, and investment in research and development.

Effective innovation systems require a balance between competition and cooperation, as well as a mix of public and private investments in research and development.

Different countries have different strengths and weaknesses in their innovation systems, and it is important to understand the unique characteristics of each system in order to promote successful innovation policies and practices.

Overall, the book argues that a strong and effective national innovation system is critical for economic growth, competitiveness, and social well-being, and that policymakers, business leaders, and researchers all have a role to play in shaping and supporting these systems.
