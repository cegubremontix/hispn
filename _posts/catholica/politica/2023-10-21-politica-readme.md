# Political Systems

> “The science of government it is my duty to study, more than all other sciences; the arts of legislation and administration and negotiation ought to take the place of, indeed exclude, in a manner, all other arts. I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain.” ― John Adams, Letters of John Adams, Addressed to His Wife

> **Ley** es un instrumento de poder que se negocia.

> **Political System:** The organization of power and governance within a society. Examples include democracy, monarchy, oligarchy, theocracy, and authoritarianism.

> **Corporatism**: Corporatism is a collectivist[1] political ideology which advocates the organization of society by corporate groups, such as agricultural, labour, military, business, scientific, or guild associations, on the basis of their common interests.[2][3] The term is derived from the Latin corpus, or "body". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism

> **Pluralism**: Pluralism as a political philosophy is the recognition and affirmation of diversity within a political body, which is seen to permit the peaceful coexistence of different interests, convictions, and lifestyles.[1] While not all political pluralists advocate for a pluralist democracy, this is most common as democracy is often viewed as the most fair and effective way to moderate between the discrete values.[2] As put by arch-pluralist Isaiah Berlin, "let us have the courage of our admitted ignorance, of our doubts and uncertainties. At least we can try to discover what others ... require, by ... making it possible for ourselves to know men as they truly are, by listening to them carefully and sympathetically, and understanding them and their lives and their needs... ."[3] Pluralism thus tries to encourage members of society to accommodate their differences by avoiding extremism (adhering solely to one value, or at the very least refusing to recognize others as legitimate) and engaging in good faith dialogue. Pluralists also seek the construction or reform of social institutions in order to reflect and balance competing principles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralism_(political_philosophy)

> **Consenso**: Consenso viene del latin "consensus"  y significa "con la aprobacion de todos". Sus componentes lexicos con el prefijo-**con** (junto, todo) y **sensus** (sentidos).

## Political Polarization

Political polarization (spelled polarisation in British English) is the divergence of political attitudes away from the centre, towards ideological extremes.

### Structures of Organizations

**Functional organizations**: These organizations are structured around specific functions, such as finance, marketing, or production. Employees are grouped according to their area of expertise and work under a functional manager.

**Divisional organizations**: These organizations are structured around specific products, geographic regions, or customer groups. Each division operates independently and has its own set of functions and resources.

**Matrix organizations**: These organizations combine functional and divisional structures, with employees reporting to both a functional manager and a divisional manager. This allows for more flexibility and collaboration across different parts of the organization.

**Flat organizations**: These organizations have a minimal hierarchy and relatively few levels of management. Employees are empowered to make decisions and take on multiple responsibilities.

**Hierarchical organizations**: These organizations have a more traditional structure with many levels of management and clear lines of authority. Decisions are made at the top and flow down through the organization.

**Network organizations**: These organizations are composed of a network of independent entities that work together to achieve a common goal. They are often used in industries such as software development or consulting.

**Virtual organizations**: These organizations operate entirely online or through technology, with employees and resources distributed across different locations.
