# Models and Representation

> A general account of modelling in physics is proposed.

> Models are representation(descriptions) of the world.

## A Model of Modelling

> A model of modeling consisting of three key components: denotation, demonstration, and interpretation.

> `Denotation` is the core of `representation` and the difference from resemblance.

> A model of a physical system to "be a symbol for it, stand for it, refer to it."

- **Denotation**: `Denotation` refers to the process of representing elements of the physical world within the model. The model assigns symbols, representations, or abstractions to real-world entities or phenomena, capturing their essential characteristics in a structured manner.

- **Demonstration**: The `demonstration` component encompasses the internal dynamics of the model. It involves the model's ability to simulate, analyze, or generate outputs based on its internal processes, rules, or algorithms. By leveraging its internal workings, the model can showcase theoretical conclusions, predictions, or behavior relevant to the problem domain it represents.

- **Interpretation**: The `interpretation` component is crucial for understanding and extracting meaningful insights from the outputs generated by the model. The model's outputs need to be interpreted in the context of the problem being modeled, considering domain knowledge, expertise, and critical analysis. Interpreting the model's outputs involves deriving insights, making informed decisions, or gaining a deeper understanding of the phenomena under investigation.
