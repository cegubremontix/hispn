# The Art of Economic Catch-Up

> Description of the process of **catching up** (development): its **barriers**, **failures** (lack of capacity), and some solutions **(detours)** / **leap- frog** / **find a new path**.

> The economic literature endeavors to find a **universal factor for economic growth** that will bind all countries, regardless of income level and structural differences.

> **Development** generally refers to growth, progress, or advancement toward a goal or desired state.

**Barriers**:
- **Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)** protect advanced economies.

**Failures (Lack of Capacity):**
- **Firm Capability**: Hard to build innovation capabilities,
- **Size Failures**: Lack of world-class business in developing countries.

**What detours to take?**
- From Imitative -> Innovation.
- From Short-Cycle to Long-Cycle
- More, Less, and More GVC Again

**Specific Advices**:
- Enter a low-end segment free from competition from the advanced economies.
- Imitative Innovation:  Under a Loose IPR regime in the form of petit patents and trademarks instead of promoting and strengthening regular pattern rights.
- GVC: Increase integration, decrease integration, to later increase integration again.
    - Use the global value chain to learn, then establish local value chains.
    - The establishment of local value chains is vital for competitiveness.
- Short Cycle Technology: Specialise in short cycle technological sectors like (IT) and only go long cycles like (pharmaceuticals) at later stages.
- investing in education and research and development,
- promoting industrial clusters,
- and implementing policies that support Innovation and entrepreneurship.


**Leapfrog**:

Take a technology - use it / explore it first; use that window of opportunity (when the advanced economies are using good enough technologies).

**Find a New Path**:

- Find a unexplore new technology,
- Find a unsolves-problems for unexplores markets,
- ...

**What are the fundamental technological categories?**
- **Energy technologies**: This category includes technologies used to generate, store, and distribute energy, such as renewable energy technologies (e.g., solar, wind, and hydropower), nuclear power, and fossil fuel technologies.
- **Information and communication technologies (ICTs)**: This category includes technologies used to process, transmit, and store information, such as computers, the Internet, and telecommunications systems.
- **Manufacturing technologies**: This category includes technologies that are used to create products, such as automation, robotics, and 3D printing.
- **Transportation technologies**: These include technologies used to transport people and goods, such as automobiles, airplanes, trains, and ships.
- **Materials technologies**: This category includes technologies used to create new materials or modify existing materials, such as nanotechnology, advanced polymers, and composite materials.
- **Environmental technologies**: This category includes technologies that address environmental challenges, such as waste management, water treatment, and pollution control.
- **Agricultural technologies**: This category includes technologies used in agriculture, such as precision agriculture, genetic engineering of crops, and soil management technologies.
- **Biotechnology**: This category includes technologies that use living organisms or biological processes to develop new products and processes, such as genetic engineering, bioremediation, and biopharmaceuticals.

**Economic Well-Being is achieved once a society improves its computational engine either by:**
- Learning how to compute new products,
- Learning how to compute products with more efficiency.
