# Math Does Not Represent

> A **physical theory** is a body of inter-related knowledge and understanding, both theoretical and experimental, about some more or less clearly delineated part of the physical world (classical viscöelastic, thermoconductive fluids, e.g., or weakly ionized, inviscid plasmas).

By ‘represent’ here I mean in anything like a standard philosophical sense of designative, depictive or  verisimilous representation of the world by the mathematics of our best physical theories, e.g.:

- a **Tarskian** relation of designation between elements of a math-ematical space (“the space of states”) and states of a physical system as in some versions of the semantic view (designative)

- or **similarity** along the lines of **Giere** (depictive)

- or the existence of a **homomorphism** of some kind between
mathematical stuff and stuff in the world à la the structural-ists (verisimilous)

- or a possible-worlds semantics for solutions to equations of motion or field equations
