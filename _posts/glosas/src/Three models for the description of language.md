# Three models for the description of language

Paper "Three Models for the Description of Langauge"
- Markovian Sources,
- Re-writing Systems / Post-Rewriting Systems  / Finite Automata
- Transformation Grammar (This is the only model that makes sense to Chomsky to describe language, the other ones are wrong descriptive models).

What is a model for the description of language?

> It's a structure a provide grammar (simple and revealing) that can generate all the sentences in a language "say English".

> It's a construct that explain the ability of a speaker to **produce** and understand new sentences, and to **reject** as ungrammatical other new sequences, on the basis of his limited linguistic experience.

> It's the creation of a finite system for the representation of the sentences.

> A Language is a set of finite or infinite sentences, constructed from a final alphabet of symbols.

## Markovian Sources

> No Finite-State Markov Process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English Grammar.

> Indented block.
