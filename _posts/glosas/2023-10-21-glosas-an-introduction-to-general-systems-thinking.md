# An Introduction to General Systems Thinking

> This book delves into a groundbreaking methodology that shifts the paradigm of reductionism to embrace the modeling of complex systems. By challenging traditional reductionist approaches, it introduces a fresh perspective on understanding and representing the intricacies of complex systems through innovative modeling techniques. The book serves as a comprehensive guide, exploring the principles, tools, and applications of this transformative methodology, ultimately reshaping the way we perceive and analyze complex phenomena.

> Randomness - is most important for systems thinking, thought randomness often leads to properties quite contrary to our intuition.

> Every mode i ultimately the expression of one thing we think we hope to udnerstand in terms of another thng we thing we do understand.

> Man is by nature methaphysical and proud. He has gone as far as to think that the idealistic creations of his mind, which corresond to his feelings, also represent rality. - Claude Bernard.

> “The general idea is always an abstraction and, for that very reason, in some sort a negation of real life. And every time that scientific men, emerging from their abstract world, mingle with living creation in the real world, all that they propose or create is poor, ridiculously abstract, bloodless and lifeless, still-born, like the homunculus created by Wagner, the pedantic disciple of the immortal Doctor Faust.” — Mikhail Bakunin
