## Why Prepare

**Communicate who yo are in the organization's language?**

First off, nothing is wrong with you. What often messes people up is a lack of understanding of how to communicate who they are. One of the ways to communicate is to notice the company lingo.

- What are their taglines?
- How do they describe their brand?
- Are the sentences on their website short and concise or verbose and detailed?
- Do they call their employees “employees,” or do they use another noun?
- How do they describe their customers?

**Everyone is an Interviewer**

Use good manners! Because every one will make an opinion of you.

**The Purpose of Behavioral Interviews**

Past behavior is predictor of future behavior.

## Preparing/Homework

**Doing your Homework**

- Research the organization
- News
- ....

Pro tip: Keep in mind that the job description may or may not accurately represent the role. Sometimes, the interviewers may not be familiar with the details of the posted job description, or the actual role may differ in meaningful ways. This being said, as the interviewee, you must be familiar with the job posting.

Questions to ask yourself

- What industry does the organization operate in?
- Who are the competitors?
- What share of the market do they have?
- What are the aspects of their brand? Do they have a logo? Colors? Tagline(s)?
- What is their mission and values?
- What are the most important products and services?
- What do customers say?
- Is this an old industry or new industry?
- What is the size of the industry with respect to the national or global economy?
- Does the organization compete on price or quality?
- How do they differentiate their products or services?

## Create a List of Experiences

- Times when you felt a huge sense of accomplishment or success.
- Times when you fixed something that wasn’t working.
- A time when you had to make a challenging decision.
- A time when you had to influence a leader or team.
- Times when you got surprised by something or had overlooked something.
- Times when you removed barriers or came up with a creative solution.
- A time when you failed but learned.
- A time when you had to defuse​ an escalating situation.

## The START Response

![start](https://gitlab.com/dbremont/resources/-/raw/main/images/starttech.png)

The start technique helps us structuring our response.

**Situation**. Describe a specific situation. You need to give enough information that the interviewer will be able to understand the circumstances.

**Task**. What were you asked or expected to do and why? What was driving you (and/or your team) to complete this project or solve this problem? What were your responsibilities in that situation?

**Action**. Describe the actions taken. You should prioritize what you did, what your contribution was, and how those things were impactful. Focus on “I," not “we”.

**Result**. Describe the outcome. DO NOT undercut your role in the situation, this is not the time to be modest. When talking about the result, make sure you go over what happened, how the event ended, what was accomplished, and what you learned. Be positive. Even if the outcome was unsatisfactory, it is important that something positive came from it. Remember, even when things are negative (or not what you had hoped) good things can still come from them. Oftentimes, individuals have to be prompted in this section of their answer; stand out by including this part on your own.

## Borrowing from other disciplines

In writing this course, we reviewed advice and materials from the legal profession. Believe it or not, many of the techniques used to prepare witnesses to testify at trial apply to effective interviewing.

**Answer the question that was asked**

Practice explaining your experiences, without acronyms and jargon, to someone outside your field and be sure they understand.

Get confirmation**

If you are unsure of the question, ask for it to be prepare. You might also say:

- I’m not following the question, can you ask it in another way?
- Can you tell me a bit more about what you want?
- Do you mean……?

## Recognizing Behavioral Interview Questions

**Spotting a behavioral question**

How will you recognize behavioral questions? Behavioral interview questions will be asked in a few different ways, but they are all intended to prompt you into describing your behavior. Listen for the following openings:

- Tell me about a time when…
- Can you share a situation when…
- What do you do when…
- Give me an example of…
- Describe a…

When you hear any of these openings, you’ll know what kind of response the interviewer is looking for.

**Small talk**

Be ready with genuine answers to questions like these:

- What do you like to do in your free time?
- What book are you reading right now?
- Seen any good movies lately?
- Are you a sports fan?
- Do you have any exciting trips planned?

## Prior Experience Questions

Prior experience questions are intended to prompt you into sharing examples from your life. The idea behind these questions is that your past experiences are predictors of future behavior. As you answer these questions, interviewers are listening to understand your instincts and influences.

Make sure that everything you say in a response is relevant to the response. Everything that you mention should come back around, if it doesn’t, then it should not be included. For example, think of a recipe in a cookbook. The “ingredient” section only lists things that will be used to make the dish - nothing more, nothing less. Do the same for your answers.

**Sample questions​**

- What was the last project you led, and what was its outcome?
- Give me an example of a time that you felt you went above and beyond at work.
- Describe a time when your work was criticized, how you responded, and what happened as a result.
- Have you ever been on a team where someone was not doing their part? How did you handle it?
- Tell me about a time when you had to give someone difficult feedback. How did you handle it?
- How do you handle working with people who annoy you?
- What was the most difficult period in your life, and how did you deal with it?

- Give me an example of a time you did something wrong. How did you handle it?
    - I was working as an App Developer for XYZ Company when a Zero-Day Privilege Elevation vulnerability was discovered. Microsoft issued a patch and we had 6000 Windows servers running in 4 different data centers that all needed to be patched as quickly and efficiently as possible (Situation). It wasn’t my job to patch servers, but the VP asked all of us for ideas to get the work done faster (Tasks). I suggested that several of us could help do validation if the procedure was documented. Others could help with tracking the servers coming in and out of rotation and updating tickets. This freed up the Systems Engineers to do the work that only they could do (Actions). I had never done some of those tasks before, so I had to follow procedures exactly and ask for help if I wasn’t sure about something. I was willing to take directions and learn. I took good notes and helped make the documentation easier to follow (Results). I gained a new appreciation for the Systems and Security Engineers. We worked long hours, but it felt good to pull together. It was also good to know that we could do that again if a serious security issue came up.

- Describe a mentor who has impacted you in a positive way.
- Was there a person in your career who really made a difference? In what way?
- Tell me about your proudest achievement.

## Asking Questions

Rule #1: Always have questions ready to ask the interviewer.

Rule #2: If, during the interview, you have developed a good rapport and natural curiosity about the interviewer or something that the interviewer said, ask that question instead of a prepared one.

Rule #3: The best method is to ask your interviewer questions that give them a chance to talk about themselves. This helps you avoid asking questions about things that you could have easily learned from their website. It also demonstrates relationship-building skills and gives you a reason to be genuine. Luckily, asking questions about another person’s experiences or opinions comes naturally in conversation – don’t overthink it, be human.

Rule #4: Ask open-ended questions that elicit a response beyond “yes” or “no.”

Rule #5: This is not the time to ask questions about compensation, hours, perks, or titles. Asking such questions could potentially plant ideas about your motivations and drivers that may work against you. Instead, ask questions that are in the same context as the behavioral interview. This is your chance to find out if the organization’s values are just marketing buzzwords or truly a part of the culture.
