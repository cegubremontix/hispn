This biologically-grounded perspective provides important insights in the domains of both neurobiology and neuro-inspired artificial intelligence. On the neurobiological side, we look to identify signatures of these computational mechanisms in actual neurophysiological data; on the artificial intelligence side, we gain an understanding of which biological motifs have been algorithmically implemented and which have not."
