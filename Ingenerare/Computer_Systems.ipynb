        "For any given hardware architecture, there is a Basic Addressable Unit (BAU), which is the smallest unit of memory with a unique address. These days it is almost always the eight-bit byte. But in the past there have been processors (such as the Intel 4004) with a four-bit BAU, and mainframes with large BAUs (e.g., the DEC-10 series which addresses 36-bit words). A few microcontrollers even are bit-addressable.\n",
        "\n",
        "For any machine which is not bit-addressable, a program can still access individual bits, but it needs to do that using bit-wise operations (such as AND, OR, and NOT) on some larger unit, such as a byte."
