It’s important to keep in mind that looking at a single quarter’s metrics is only a snapshot of the company, and there are several metrics that each try to capture the health of the company, but in slightly different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In a way, analyzing a company’s fundamentals is like going on a safari taking photographs of an antelope. A single still photo from one angle may tell you some things about the antelope, but taking multiple photos from different angles will give you a better view. Also, taking multiple photos over time will give you a sense of where the antelope is going. So before we introduce some commonly used metrics, please keep in mind that to get a better picture of a company that you’re trying to analyze, you’ll want to look at a collection of different measures over time.\n",

        "- Sales Per Share\n",
        "  - A company’s revenue is based on its sales over that quarter, so we can think of sales and revenue as referring to the same thing. It’s a quick way to get a sense for how a company is doing, because we don’t have to subtract out cost of sales, which depends a bit on some accounting decisions. For example, if a company sells a million smartphones for a hundred dollars each over the past 3 months, then its revenue is USD100 times 1 million, or USD100 million. If the company issued ten million shares, then its sales per share is USD100 million divided by ten million, or $10 per share.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - You may be wondering why we bother dividing sales by the number of shares. This helps shareholders get a sense of how much the sales figures might impact a change in a single share price. You can imagine that if the company only issued 10 shares, a report of higher sales than forecasted would impact each share more than if the company issued ten million shares.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Also, note that sales of USD10 per share probably does not mean that the shareholders will get USD10 for each share that they own, or that their stock price will increase by USD10. It costs money for the company to make each smartphone. Let’s take a look at a metric that accounts for cost of sales next.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Earnings Per Share\n",
        "  - Earnings is the company’s revenue minus its cost of sales. Cost of sales refers to the cost of manufacturing the phone, employee wages, rent payments for office space, and the cost of equipment, like machines that make the phones. Earnings gives investors a sense of how much the equity of the company has changed over the past 3 months. Recall that stock represents a fractional ownership of a company’s equity.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Continuing with the smartphone company example, let’s say we can estimate the cost of sales per phone to be USD80 per phone. If the sales per phone is USD100, then the earnings per phone is USD100 - USD80 equals USD20 per phone. With sales of one million phones, earnings would be $20 times one million, or USD20 million.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - With ten million shares, this is earnings of USD20 million divided by ten million shares, which is USD2 earnings per share.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Note again, that this USD2 per share doesn’t mean that investors automatically receive an additional $2 per share in their pocket. Let’s look at one way that investors do receive some of those earnings by looking at dividends.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dividends Per Share\n",
        "  - After a company has positive earnings, they may decide to either reinvest the cash in growing the company’s business. A company’s executives are usually expected to make spending decisions based on maximizing shareholder value. Whether this always happens in practice is debatable, but ideally, if the executives decide that re-investing in the business yields lower returns than an investor could gain from investing in a similar business at the same level of risk, they will give some of the earnings to shareholders as cash. This cash is referred to as dividends.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Let’s say, for example, that the smartphone company decides to return USD10 million of its earnings to its shareholders. The dividend per share is then USD10 million divided by 10 million, or USD1 per share."

        "\n",
        "A term you’ll see often is price to earnings ratio, or PE ratio for short. This is the stock’s current market price divided by its most recently reported earnings per share (EPS). You can sort of interpret the PE ratio as how much the company is valued compared to how much money it made. It’s important to be careful about how we interpret a high or low PE ratio, because we can’t say whether a PE ratio is good or bad by looking at it in isolation. Let’s first look at where the price comes from. This market price of a share is based on the collective estimates by investors of the company’s current equity plus its future earnings. The future earnings are based on estimates of future cash flow, which are then adjusted to their present-day value, or Present Value (PV). This is getting a bit outside the scope of what you’ll need to know for this course, but the point we want you to remember is that the market price of a stock is based on both its current assets minus liabilities, but also estimates of the company’s future performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now coming back to the PE ratio. What does it mean to have a high PE ratio? A company may have low or negative earnings, but a high stock price. Why do you think that is? You may have heard of certain startups that are valued at billions of dollars, and yet have low earnings. This is because investors expect potential for high earnings growth, based on the trajectory of past earnings growth. This also means that investors are estimating that the high stock price relative to earnings will be justified by high future earnings. On the other hand, it’s also possible that investor optimism towards the company’s future never materializes, in which case the stock may be overpriced.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note also that a low PE ratio can also be due to different underlying reasons. An example of a company with a low PE ratio may be one that has high and stable earnings, but less expectations for future growth. Since the company may decide that its investors are better off receiving earnings as dividends instead of reinvesting earnings into the business, the earnings will be distributed as cash to shareholders. This also means that the stock price itself represents the value of the company excluding the cash that was already distributed to these shareholders. Again, keep in mind that a low PE ratio can also be a sign of something else. If a company is expected to face pressure from competitors or government regulation that reduce their expectations for future earnings, then investors may pay a lower price for each share, and that could also result in a lower PE ratio.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, you’ll want to see how a company’s PE ratio compares to other similar companies in the same industry and same geographic region.\n",
        "\n",
        "You’ll see PE ratios again in later lessons, so for now, just remember that it’s one of many ways to take a snapshot of a company’s financial health."

        "\n",
        "1. Log returns can be interpreted as continuously compounded returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Log returns are time-additive. The multi-period log return is simply the sum of single period log returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The use of log returns prevents security prices from becoming negative in models of security returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. For many purposes, log returns of a security can be reasonably modeled as distributed according to a normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. When returns and log returns are small (their absolute values are much less than 1), their values are approximately equal.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Logarithms can help make an algorithm more numerically stable.\n",

Each of these produce p-value, and if the p-value is small enough, say 0.05 or less, we can say with a 95% confidence that the data is not normally distributed. Shapiro-Wilk tends to perform better in a broader set of cases compared to the D’Agostino-Pearson test. In part, this is because the D’Agostino-Pearson test is used to look for skewness and kurtosis that do not match a normal distribution, so there are some odd non-normal distributions for which it doesn’t detect non-normality, where the Sharpiro-Wilk would give the correct answer.\n",

In general, the Shapiro-WIlk test tends to be a better test than the Kolmogorov Smirnov test, but not in all cases.\n",

It takes the residuals from a regression, and checks if they are dependent upon the independent variables that we fed into the regression. (Note that we’ll explain residuals in a few videos within this lesson, so feel free to jump back here after you watch the video “Linear Regression”). The test does this by performing a second regression of the residuals against the independent variables, and checking if the coefficients from that second regression are statistically significant (non-zero). If the coefficients of this second regression are significant, then the residuals depend upon the independent variables. If the residuals depend upon the independent variables, then it means that the variance of the data depends on the independent variables. In other words, the data is likely heteroscedastic. So if the p-value of the Breusch-Pagan test is ≤ 0.05, we can assume with a 95% confidence that the distribution is heteroscedastic (not homoscedastic).\n",

        "\n",
        "The drift and volatility model is also called a Brownian Motion model, and is a type of stochastic volatility model. First, let’s discuss how this relates to the finance industry. Stochastic volatility models are fundamental building blocks for estimating the price of options (calls, puts, swaps) and also bonds. Before creating a model of an option (like a call option, for instance), we first want a model for the movement of its underlying asset (the stock price itself). The movement of the stock price is what the drift and volatility model (brownian motion model) attempts to describe.\n",
        "The word Brownian Motion refers to the movements of molecules suspended in fluid, since this model was first used in physics and later adapted for finance. So it helps to imagine the stock price as a small particle, drifting through a glass of water, while it’s being bumped around by other particles and molecules. The word “stochastic” is another word for “random”. Stochastic volatility models attempt to represent the movement of a stock price when the volatility of its movements is random. Stochastic volatility models were used to improve upon the work of Black, Scholes and Merton, who came up with the first formula for pricing options.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now let’s revisit the drift and volatility model and describe what it means.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "First, notice that $dp_t$  on the left is referring to the differential of the stock price at time t. This type of equation is called a differential equation, since it describes the change over time of some process, rather than the specific state (stock price) of that series.\n",
        "\n",
        "The term $p_t \\mu dt$ is the drift term. First, notice that it depends on the value of the stock price at time t $(p_t)$. This means that if we compare the movements of two stocks, one that’s priced at USD 2 per share, and another that’s priced at USD 1000 per share, the series with the larger price per share is expected to drift (change) more in absolute dollar amounts compared to the other stock. The $\\mu$ term is the expected return of the stock (think average return). Think of the expected return as the expected percent change over a period of time. We usually estimate the expected future return based on historical returns. So if a stock is expected to have a larger percent change per day compared to another, we’d also expect it to drift more (change more) compared to the other stock. This term also includes $d_td$, which is the change in time (how much time has passed). If we watched a stock over a period of day versus over one month, we would expect it to drift more over a month, as more time has passed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now let’s look at the volatility term. Think of this as the random, bouncy part of the stock movement. This term includes the stock price $p_tp$. It also includes the standard deviation of the stock $\\sigma_t$ , which is a function of time. This is why this model is a type of stochastic volatility model, because it allows for a non-constant volatility that varies over time. If a stock series has higher volatility, this will result in a larger overall movement in stock price (a higher $dp_tdp$). The $\\epsilon$ is a white noise term, which means it’s a random number with a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. The white noise accounts for movements in the stock price that are not accounted for by the model. Finally, there’s the square root of the change in time. Note that the product $\\epsilon_t \\sqrt(d_t)$ is usually written as $dW_t$ , and named a Wiener process.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Back to Mean Reversion\n",
        "Okay, stepping back a bit to relate this to mean reversion. The drift and volatility model is a way to describe phenomena that we observe in real life, such as stock prices. The model assumes that there is a constant drift term with some added randomness, so we can expect that a series will bounce around, but still revert back to its long-term mean.\n"

By contrast, a purely alpha fund may create a portfolio of specific stocks, not related to an index, or may choose from the global universe of stocks. The other characteristic that makes a smart beta portfolio \"beta\" is that it gives its investors a diversified broad exposure to a particular market.\n",

Smart Beta originally referred to a specific kind of alternative weighting, which is fundamental weighting. Alternative weighting refers to anything other than market cap weighting. Market cap weighting is very common because it reflects the market movement (big companies affect the market more than small ones do).\n",

So, for instance, a smart beta fund would implement fundamental weighting by buying more shares of stocks whose market price decreased but book value did not change; they would also sell shares in stocks whose market price increased but book value did not change. Other fundamentals could be dividends issued or price earnings ratios. This fundamental weighting applying a bit of “alpha” to a beta fund by using weighting rules that are designed to overweight stocks that may generate better outcomes.\n",
