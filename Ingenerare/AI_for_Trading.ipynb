        "- Fundamental analysis of a company involves looking at a company’s balance sheet and cash flow statements, which are usually updated every quarter, which is every three months when the company reports earnings. It’s important to keep in mind that looking at a single quarter’s metrics is only a snapshot of the company, and there are several metrics that each try to capture the health of the company, but in slightly different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In a way, analyzing a company’s fundamentals is like going on a safari taking photographs of an antelope. A single still photo from one angle may tell you some things about the antelope, but taking multiple photos from different angles will give you a better view. Also, taking multiple photos over time will give you a sense of where the antelope is going. So before we introduce some commonly used metrics, please keep in mind that to get a better picture of a company that you’re trying to analyze, you’ll want to look at a collection of different measures over time.\n",

        "**Some metrics**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Sales Per Share\n",
        "  - A company’s revenue is based on its sales over that quarter, so we can think of sales and revenue as referring to the same thing. It’s a quick way to get a sense for how a company is doing, because we don’t have to subtract out cost of sales, which depends a bit on some accounting decisions. For example, if a company sells a million smartphones for a hundred dollars each over the past 3 months, then its revenue is USD100 times 1 million, or USD100 million. If the company issued ten million shares, then its sales per share is USD100 million divided by ten million, or $10 per share.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - You may be wondering why we bother dividing sales by the number of shares. This helps shareholders get a sense of how much the sales figures might impact a change in a single share price. You can imagine that if the company only issued 10 shares, a report of higher sales than forecasted would impact each share more than if the company issued ten million shares.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Also, note that sales of USD10 per share probably does not mean that the shareholders will get USD10 for each share that they own, or that their stock price will increase by USD10. It costs money for the company to make each smartphone. Let’s take a look at a metric that accounts for cost of sales next.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Earnings Per Share\n",
        "  - Earnings is the company’s revenue minus its cost of sales. Cost of sales refers to the cost of manufacturing the phone, employee wages, rent payments for office space, and the cost of equipment, like machines that make the phones. Earnings gives investors a sense of how much the equity of the company has changed over the past 3 months. Recall that stock represents a fractional ownership of a company’s equity.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Continuing with the smartphone company example, let’s say we can estimate the cost of sales per phone to be USD80 per phone. If the sales per phone is USD100, then the earnings per phone is USD100 - USD80 equals USD20 per phone. With sales of one million phones, earnings would be $20 times one million, or USD20 million.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - With ten million shares, this is earnings of USD20 million divided by ten million shares, which is USD2 earnings per share.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Note again, that this USD2 per share doesn’t mean that investors automatically receive an additional $2 per share in their pocket. Let’s look at one way that investors do receive some of those earnings by looking at dividends.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dividends Per Share\n",
        "  - After a company has positive earnings, they may decide to either reinvest the cash in growing the company’s business. A company’s executives are usually expected to make spending decisions based on maximizing shareholder value. Whether this always happens in practice is debatable, but ideally, if the executives decide that re-investing in the business yields lower returns than an investor could gain from investing in a similar business at the same level of risk, they will give some of the earnings to shareholders as cash. This cash is referred to as dividends.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Let’s say, for example, that the smartphone company decides to return USD10 million of its earnings to its shareholders. The dividend per share is then USD10 million divided by 10 million, or USD1 per share."

        "**todo summarize**\n",
        "\n",
        "A term you’ll see often is price to earnings ratio, or PE ratio for short. This is the stock’s current market price divided by its most recently reported earnings per share (EPS). You can sort of interpret the PE ratio as how much the company is valued compared to how much money it made. It’s important to be careful about how we interpret a high or low PE ratio, because we can’t say whether a PE ratio is good or bad by looking at it in isolation. Let’s first look at where the price comes from. This market price of a share is based on the collective estimates by investors of the company’s current equity plus its future earnings. The future earnings are based on estimates of future cash flow, which are then adjusted to their present-day value, or Present Value (PV). This is getting a bit outside the scope of what you’ll need to know for this course, but the point we want you to remember is that the market price of a stock is based on both its current assets minus liabilities, but also estimates of the company’s future performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now coming back to the PE ratio. What does it mean to have a high PE ratio? A company may have low or negative earnings, but a high stock price. Why do you think that is? You may have heard of certain startups that are valued at billions of dollars, and yet have low earnings. This is because investors expect potential for high earnings growth, based on the trajectory of past earnings growth. This also means that investors are estimating that the high stock price relative to earnings will be justified by high future earnings. On the other hand, it’s also possible that investor optimism towards the company’s future never materializes, in which case the stock may be overpriced.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note also that a low PE ratio can also be due to different underlying reasons. An example of a company with a low PE ratio may be one that has high and stable earnings, but less expectations for future growth. Since the company may decide that its investors are better off receiving earnings as dividends instead of reinvesting earnings into the business, the earnings will be distributed as cash to shareholders. This also means that the stock price itself represents the value of the company excluding the cash that was already distributed to these shareholders. Again, keep in mind that a low PE ratio can also be a sign of something else. If a company is expected to face pressure from competitors or government regulation that reduce their expectations for future earnings, then investors may pay a lower price for each share, and that could also result in a lower PE ratio.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, you’ll want to see how a company’s PE ratio compares to other similar companies in the same industry and same geographic region.\n",
        "\n",
        "You’ll see PE ratios again in later lessons, so for now, just remember that it’s one of many ways to take a snapshot of a company’s financial health."
