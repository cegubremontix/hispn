        "**Project**: Maven things in terms of projects. Everything that you will build are projects. Those projects follow a well defined \"Project Object Model\". Projects can depend on other projects, in which case the latter are called \"dependencies\". A project may consist of several subprojects, howerver these subprojects are still treated  equally as projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Project Object Model (POM)**: The Project Object Model, almost always deferred as the POM for brevity, is the metadata that Maven needs to work with your project. Its name is \"project.xml\" and it is located in the root directory of each projet.\n",

        "**Artifact**: An artifact is something that is either produced or used by a project. Examples of artifacts produced by Maven for a project include: JARS, source and binary distributions, WARs. Each artifact is identified by a **group id**, an **artifact ID**, a **version**, an **extention  and a classifier** (extention+classifier may be named by a type)\n",
        "\n",
        "**GroupId**: A group ID a universally unique identifier for a project. Whjile is often just the name, it is helful to use a fully qualified package name to distinguish it from other projects with similar name.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dependency**: A typical Java project relies on libraries to build and/or run. Those called \"dependencies\" inside Maven. Those dependencies are usually other project's JAR artifacts, but are referenced by the POM that describes them.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Plug-In**: Maven is organized on plugins. Every piece of functionality in Maven is provided by a pluging. Plugins provide goals and use the matadata found in the POM to perform their task. Examples are: jar, eclipse, war. Plugings are primarely written in Java ,mbut Maven also supports writing plug-ins Beanshell and Ant Scripting.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Mojo**:  A plugin in Java consisnt of one or more mojos. A mojo is a Java class that implements the org.apache.maven.plugin.Mojo interface. This means that a mojo is the implementation for a **goal in a plugin**.\n",

        "- Local,\n",

        "**Snapshots**: Projects can and (should) have a special version includign **SNAPSHOT** to indicate that they are a 'work in progress', and are not yet released. When a snapshopt dependency is encountered, it is always looked for in all remote repositories, and downloaded again if newer than the local copy.\n",
