        "\n",
        "We present Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), a distributed memory abstraction that lets programmers perform in-memory computations on large clusters in a fault-tolerant manner. \n",
        "\n",
        "RDDs are motivated by two types of applications that current computing frameworks handle inefficiently: \n",
        "- iterative algorithms and \n",
        "- interactive data mining tools. \n",
        "\n",
        "In both cases, keeping data in memory can improve performance by an order of magnitude.\n",
        "\n",
        "To achieve fault tolerance efficiently, RDDs provide a restricted form of shared memory, based on coarse-grained transformations rather than fine-grained updates to shared state. However, we show that RDDs are expressive enough to capture a wide class of computations, including recent specialized programming models for iterative jobs, such as Pregel, and new applications that these models do not capture.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have implemented RDDs in a system called Spark, which we evaluate through a variety of user applications and benchmarks."
