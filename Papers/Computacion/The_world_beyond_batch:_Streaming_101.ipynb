        "Streaming data processing is a big deal in big data these days, and for good reasons. Amongst them:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Businesses crave ever more timely data, and switching to streaming is a good way to achieve lower latency.\n",
        "    The massive, unbounded data sets that are increasingly common in modern business are more easily tamed using a system designed for such never-ending volumes of data.\n",
        "    Processing data as they arrive spreads workloads out more evenly over time, yielding more consistent and predictable consumption of resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite this business-driven surge of interest in streaming, the majority of streaming systems in existence remain relatively immature compared to their batch brethren, which has resulted in a lot of exciting, active development in the space recently.\n",
        "\n",
        "As someone who’s worked on massive-scale streaming systems at Google for the last five+ years (MillWheel, Cloud Dataflow), I’m delighted by this streaming zeitgeist, to say the least. I’m also interested in making sure that folks understand everything that streaming systems are capable of and how they are best put to use, particularly given the semantic gap that remains between most existing batch and streaming systems. To that end, the fine folks at O’Reilly have invited me to contribute a written rendition of my Say Goodbye to Batch talk from Strata + Hadoop World London 2015. Since I have quite a bit to cover, I’ll be splitting this across two separate posts:"
