        "The MapReduce7 (MR) paradigm has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-scale, massively parallel data access.16 Some proponents claim the extreme scalability of MR will relegate relational database management systems (DBMS) to the status of legacy technology. At least one enterprise, Facebook, has implemented a large data warehouse system using MR technology rather than a DBMS.14\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we argue that using MR systems to perform tasks that are best suited for DBMSs yields less than satisfactory results,17 concluding that MR is more like an extract-transform-load (ETL) system than a DBMS, as it quickly loads and processes large amounts of data in an ad hoc manner. As such, it complements DBMS technology rather than competes with it. We also discuss the differences in the architectural decisions of MR systems and database systems and provide insight into how the systems should complement one another."
