        "Disk-oriented approaches to online storage are becoming increasingly problematic: they do not scale gracefully to meet the needs of large-scale Web applications, and improvements in disk capacity have far outstripped improvements in access latency and bandwidth. This paper argues for a new approach to datacenter\n",
        "storage called RAMCloud, where information is kept entirely in DRAM and large-scale systems are created\n",
        "by aggregating the main memories of thousands of commodity servers. We believe that RAMClouds can\n",
        "provide durable and available storage with 100-1000x the throughput of disk-based systems and 100-1000x\n",
        "lower access latency. The combination of low latency and large scale will enable a new breed of dataintensive applications. "
