        "Our exprimental evaluation shows that the method used to accept new connection request can significantly impact server performace. By modifying reach server's accept strategy,  we improve the performace of the kernel-mode TUX server, the multi-threaded Knot server and the event-driven **$\\mu$server**. Under two different workloads, we improve the throughput of these servers by as much as 19%, - 36% for **Tux**, 0%-32% for **Knot**, and 39%-71% for $\\mu$server allow it to obtain performace that rivals an unmodifief Tux server."
