        "XFS is a \"file system\" that was designed from day one for computer systems with large numbers of CPUs and large disk arrays. It focuses on supporting large files and good streaming I/O performace.\n",
        "\n",
        "XFS features:\n",
        "- Delayed allocations,\n",
        "- Extends\n",
        "\n",
        "**Space Allocation and Management**\n",
        "\n",
        "Each XFS file syste is partitioned into regions called allocations groups (AGS). Allocations groups are somewhat similar to block groups in ext3, but Ags typically much larger block groups and are used for scalability and parallelism rather than disk locality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Allocation groups are typically sized between 0.5 and 4 gigabytes and keep the size of the XFS data structures in a range where they can operate efficiently  and in parallel.\n",
        "\n",
        "Historical Unix file systems, includign ext3, use lienar bitma;s to track free space, which is inefficient specialy for larger contingous allocations. XFS instead uses a parir of B+ trees in each allocation group. Each entry in the B+ tree nodes consist of a start block and length pair describin ga free-space region. The first B+ tree is indexed by the starting block of the free region, and the other is indexed by the length of the free region. The double indexing allows the allocator to consider two goals for new data placement: locality to existing file data, and best fit into free space.\n",
        "\n",
        "A similar **extend concept** is used for tracking the disk blocks assigned to each fie. In addition to the start block of disk and the length of the contitnous range, the extend descritor also contain two additional fields.  The first  one is the logical offset in to the file, which alows for efficien tsparse file suport by skipping ranges that do not have blocks allocated to them. The second one is a simple one-bit flag to mark extend as unwritten.\n",

        "**Inodes and Extended Attributed**\n",
        "\n",
        "The XFS inode consists of three parts: the inode core, the data fork, and the optional attribute fork. The inode conre contains traditional `UNIX inode` metada such as owner group, number of blocks, timestamps, and a few XFS-specific additonal such as project ID.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Directories**\n",
        "\n",
        "XFS supports two major forms of directories. If a directory contains only a few entries and is small enough to fit into the inode, a simple unsorted linear format can store all data inide the inode's data fork.  The advantge of this format is that no external block is used and access to the directoy is extremely fast, sinse it will already be complelty cached in memory once itt is accesed. Linear algorithms, howerver, do not scale to large directoires with millions of entires. XFS thus again uses B+ trees to manage large directoires.\n",

        "\n",
        "For today's large file systems, a full file system check on an unclean shudown is not acceptable becuase it would take too long. To avoid the requirement for regular file system checks, XFS use a write-ahead loggin scheme that enables atomic updates of the file system. XFS only logs structural updates to the file system metadata, but not the actual user data, for which the `Posix file system interface` does ont provide useful atomicity guarantees.\n",
        "\n",
        "XFS logs every update to the file system data structures and does nto batch changes from multiple transactions into a single log write, as is done by ext3. This means that XFS must write significantlly more data to the log in case a single metadata structure gets modified again and again in short sequence(e.g removing a large number of small files). To mitigate the impact of log writes to the system performace, an external lgo device can be used.  With an external log the additional seeks on the main device are reduced, and the log can use the full sequential performace of the log device.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, transaction loggin does not help to protect against hardware-induced erros. To deal with these problems, XFS has an offline file sysstem checking and reapr tool caled `xfs_repair`. To deal with the ever growing disk sized and worsenign seek rates, `xfs_repair` has underdon ea major overhaul in the past few year to perform efficient read-ahead and chachign and to make use of multiple processors in SMP systems.\n",
