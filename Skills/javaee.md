Java or Java SE (Java Platform, Standard Edition) is one of the most popular programming languages that offer the ability to design and develop customized applications that are light and fast and serve various purposes. It is heavily used to build a variety of applications such as enterprise applications, network applications, desktop applications, web applications, games, Android apps, and many more that can run on a single system or be distributed across servers and clients. Java was designed to be quite easy to learn and hence writing codes, compiling and debugging is a lot easier than its other programming language counterparts. Java is also object-oriented and allows Java developers to build reusable code and modular programs. Another key reason why the language is so popular is the platform independence. As long as a system has Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed; programs can run on several different operating systems.

Java EE stands for Java Enterprise Edition. The EE platform is built on top of the SE platform and is used especially to develop large enterprise-scale applications. It offers multi-tier architecture and includes several APIs such as Enterprise JavaBeans, connectors, Servlets, Java Server Pages and several web service technologies. These APIs and the run time environment are used to develop, implement and maintain large-scale applications.
