- Mathematics Is Widely Used In Science For Modeling Phenomena. This Enables The Extraction Of Quantitative Predictions From Experimental Laws. For Example, The Movement Of Planets Can Be Predicted With High Accuracy Using Newton's Law Of Gravitation Combined With Mathematical Computation. The Independence Of Mathematical Truth From Any Experimentation Implies That The Accuracy Of Such Predictions Depends Only On The Adequacy Of The Model For Describing The Reality. So When Some Inaccurate Predictions Arise, It Means That The Model Must Be Improved Or Changed, Not That The Mathematics Is Wrong. For Example, The Perihelion Precession Of Mercury Cannot Be Explained By Newton's Law Of Gravitation, But Is Accurately Explained By Einstein's General Relativity. This Experimental Validation Of Einstein's Theory Shows That Newton's Law Of Gravitation Is Only An Approximation (Which Still Is Very Accurate In Everyday Life).
- Statistics Is The Discipline That Concerns The Collection, Organization, Analysis, Interpretation, And Presentation Of Data. In Applying Statistics To A Scientific, Industrial, Or Social Problem, It Is Conventional To Begin With A Statistical Population Or A Statistical Model To Be Studied. Populations Can Be Diverse Groups Of People Or Objects Such As "All People Living In A Country" Or "Every Atom Composing A Crystal". Statistics Deals With Every Aspect Of Data, Including The Planning Of Data Collection In Terms Of The Design Of Surveys And Experiments. When Census Data Cannot Be Collected, Statisticians Collect Data By Developing Specific Experiment Designs And Survey Samples. Representative Sampling Assures That Inferences And Conclusions Can Reasonably Extend From The Sample To The Population As A Whole. An Experimental Study Involves Taking Measurements Of The System Under Study, Manipulating The System, And Then Taking Additional Measurements Using The Same Procedure To Determine If The Manipulation Has Modified The Values Of The Measurements. In Contrast, An Observational Study Does Not Involve Experimental Manipulation.
- Computer science is the study of computation, automation, and information. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines, such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory, to practical disciplines including the design and implementation of hardware and software. Computer science is generally considered an area of academic research and distinct from computer programming. Algorithms and data structures have been called the heart of computer science. The theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. Cryptography and computer security study the means for secure communication and prevent security vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry study the generation of images. Programming language theory considers approaches to the description of computational processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data. Human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data. The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated. The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.
