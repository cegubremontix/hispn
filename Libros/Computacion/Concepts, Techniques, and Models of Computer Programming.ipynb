The new abstraction can be referred to as a refinement of the original one. Abstractions and their refinements typically do not coexist in the same system description. Precisely what is meant by a more detailed abstraction is not well defined. There needs to be support for substitutability of concepts from one abstraction to another. Composition occurs when two abstractions are used to define another higher abstraction. Decomposition occurs when an abstraction is split into smaller abstractions.\n",
