Starting with MOS transistors, the course develops a series of building blocks -- logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, finite-state machines, computers and finally complete systems. Both hardware and software mechanisms are explored through a series of design examples.\n","\n","    This course is required material for any Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) undergraduate who wants to understand (and ultimately design) digital systems. A good grasp of the material is essential for later courses in digital design, computer architecture and systems. Before taking this course, students should feel comfortable using computers; a rudimentary knowledge of programming language concepts and electrical fundamentals is assumed.\n","\n","    The problem sets and lab exercises are intended to give students \"hands-on\" experience in designing digital systems; each student completes a gate-level design for a RISC processor during the semester. Students are encouraged to get help from others in understanding the material, but the designs and measurements they hand in must be their own work.\n","\n","Course Goals\n","\n","    1. Understand the role of abstraction in the design of large digital systems, and explain the major software and hardware abstractions in contemporary computer systems.\n","    \n","    2. Analyze the performance of digital systems using measures such as latency and throughput.\n","    \n","    3. Design simple hardware systems based on a variety of digital abstractions such as ROMs and logic arrays, logic trees, state machines, pipelining, and buses. synthesize digital systems from a library of representative components and test the designs under simulation.\n","    \n","    4. Understand the operation of a moderately complex digital system -- a simple RISC-based computer -- down to the gate level, and be able to synthesize, implement, and debug its components.\n","    \n","    5. Appreciate the technical skills necessary to be a capable digital systems engineer.\n","\n","    Measurable Outcomes\n","    Upon completion of this course, students will be able to\n","\n","    1.
