Topics include specifications and invariants; testing, test-case generation, and coverage; abstract data types and representation independence; design patterns for object-oriented programming; concurrent programming, including message passing and shared concurrency, and defending against races and deadlock; and functional programming with immutable data and higher-order functions. Includes weekly programming exercises and larger group programming projects.\n","\n","Course Goals\n","\n","Course Structure\n","\n","    01: Static Checking\n","    02: Basic Java\n","    03: Testing\n","    04: Code Review\n","    05: Version Control\n","    06: Specifications\n","    07: Designing Specifications\n","    08: Avoiding Debugging\n","    09: Mutability & Immutability\n","    10: Recursion\n","    11: Debugging\n","    12: Abstract Data Types\n","    13: Abstraction Functions & Rep Invariants\n","    14: Interfaces\n","    15: Equality\n","    16: Recursive Data Types\n","    17: Regular Expressions & Grammars\n","    18: Parser Generators\n","    19: Concurrency\n","    20: Thread Safety\n","    21: Sockets & Networking\n","    22: Queues & Message-Passing\n","    23: Locks & Synchronization\n","    24: Graphical User Interfaces\n","    25: Map, Filter, Reduce\n","    26: Little Languages\n","    27: Team Version Control\n","\n","\n","Materials\n","Self Contained"]}]}
